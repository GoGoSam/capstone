## Synopsis

The purpose of this project is to engineer a solution to the labor intensive inspections
of Big Dig tunnels. To solve this problem we proposed building a robotic platform to carry
out specific inspections to reduce risk and cost to the MBTA. The goal is to design a
robot, on a limited budget and tight time constraints, that is extensible and suited
to perform a wide variety of tasks beyond just our application specific requirements.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is the Northeastern University senior capstone project
competition for the department of Electrical and Computer engineering.
